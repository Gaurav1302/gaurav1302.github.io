<b>Abstract</b> - Sketches have been employed since the ancient era of cave paintings for simple illustrations to represent real-world entities. The abstract nature and varied artistic styling makes automatic recognition of drawings more challenging than other areas of image classification. Moreover, the representation of sketches as a sequence of strokes instead of raster images introduces them at the correct abstract level. However, dealing with images as a sequence of small information makes it challenging. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based network, dubbed as TransSketchNet, for sketch recognition. This architecture incorporates ordinal information to perform the classification task in real-time through vector images.
