<!-- ## About Me -->

Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at Columbia University. I work on Human-computer Interaction with Professor [Brian A. Smith](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~brian/index.html) in the Computer-Enabled Abilities Laboratory ([CEAL](https://ceal.cs.columbia.edu/)).

## Research: Leveraging AI for Accessibility

I am interested in building systems that help people with disabilities to better experience the world around them. To this end, I leverage computer vision and deep learning for multimodal analysis -- including images, videos, and audio -- to make visual media more accessible to people who are blind and low vision. I enjoy solving technical challenges of using AI for accessibility and designing novel interaction techniques that help facilitate a more immersive user experience.
