<!-- ## About Me -->

Hi! I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Columbia University. I work on Human-computer Interaction with Professor [Brian A. Smith](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~brian/index.html) in the Computer-Enabled Abilities Laboratory ([CEAL](https://ceal.cs.columbia.edu/)).

## Research: Leveraging AI for Accessibility

I am interested in using AI -- specifically, computer vision and deep learning -- to address accessibility problems. My work is focused on designing and developing systems that help blind or low-vision (BLV) people better experience the world -- both physical and digital worlds -- around them.  

Previously, I have performed a qualitative study with BLV people to understand how navigation systems can evolve to support them in exploring unfamiliar environments, as opposed to just guiding them to their destination ([CSCW 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16465)). More recently, I developed a computer vision-based system that facilitates a more immersive experience for BLV people when watching sports, enabling them to visualize gameplay directly from videos. 

My ongoing work explores the use of multimodal representation learning and crowdsourcing to develop tools that help make videos accessible at scale. In addition, I'm exploring new forms of interactions that smart streetscapes — streets equipped with sensors and computational power — can facilitate to support BLV people's navigation. 

Here's my [CV](http://gaurav1302.github.io/files/Gaurav_CV_PhD.pdf).

<!-- - November 2022: Paper accepted at CSCW 2023. [[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16465)]  -->

<!-- My research revolves around building systems that help people with disabilities to better experience the world around them. Specifically, I am interested in leveraging computer vision and deep learning for multimodal analysis (such as videos, images, and audio) to make digital media more accessible to people who are blind and low vision. To this end, I focus on solving technical challenges of using AI for accessibility and the design of novel interaction techniques that help facilitate a more immersive user experience for people with disabilities. -->
