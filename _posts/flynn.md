I'm going to come clean and confess that I am a sucker for dark thrillers. The kind with enigmatic, twisted characters with outwardly charm and acerbic wit that belies a demented persona; ones that concoct elaborate schemes to gain retribution or right a wrong; sometimes even simply '<i>cause</i>.

It's no wonder that Gillian Flynn had me hooked instantly - I've binged through her three novels in marathon sessions - and its been largely satisfying. Here are my thoughts on them (in three parts), arranged from least favorite to most.

<b>Sharp Objects</b>

Her first novel follows Camille Preaker, a Chicago journalist with a troubled past who is forced to return to her much despised hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri, to cover the serious of gruesome murders of young girls for her newspaper. Camille is a complex, conflicted character - for starters, she has a cutting habit, and compulsively carves words into her skin when her demons get the better of her. She also shares a strained relationship with her eccentric mother Adora and her new family, which could never recover from the loss of her sister to a mysterious illness several years ago.

The novel follows her inquiry into the murder alongwith the ongoing police investigation. Much of the plot revolves around highly dysfunctional interactions with her volatile mother and precocious stepsister Amma and a brief romantic interlude that is challenged by her dirty little secret. You gradually get sucked into the curious world of little Wind Gap, existing in its own claustrophobic bubble isolated from the rest of the world. The author holds a mirror inwards on its characters, and doesn't scrimp on the ugly details.

Halfway through however, the novel begins to meander with the some unwarranted and rather implausible twists for added shock value. A gripping novelist with a macabre imagination and a penchant for pacey thrillers though Flynn is, sometimes the unpredictability she aspires to makes her all the more predictable.Even a couple of genuinely messed up reveals towards the close are eventually fizzled out by an abrupt and altogether unconvincing end. For its great build up, it almost feels like she didn't think this one through. 

This is one dementor of a novel, guaranteed to suck out any lingering positivity. Still, the Gothic theme and the atmospheric buildup make this one worth a read.

If you have the stomach for this kind of thing, that is.
